# Multi-Account Epic — Plan Index

> Linked index for the multi-account epic. Each phase is its own plan with its
> own spec → plan → build cycle. This page is the map; follow the links.

**Design spec:** [`../specs/2026-06-27-multi-account-foundation-design.md`](../specs/2026-06-27-multi-account-foundation-design.md)

## Principles carried across all phases

- **Security at each step**, not only phase 6. Each phase carries its own
  security work (e.g. Plaid-token encryption lands in phase 1).
- **Strict-first isolation.** User-centric RLS from day one; loosening later is
  a one-line policy change, tightening later is a risky migration.
- **The data layer is auth-agnostic.** Everything reads a `RequestContext`;
  phase 1 stubs it, phase 2 fills it with real auth — no data-layer churn.

| 1b | [Workspace hybrid (R2 + Postgres manifests)](2026-06-27-phase-1b-workspace-hybrid.md) | 1a | Designed (in spec); needs plan |
| 2 | [Auth / social login](2026-06-27-phase-2-auth-social-login.md) | 1a | **Planned** ([spec](../specs/2026-07-01-phase-2-auth-social-login-design.md) · [plan](2026-07-02-phase-2-auth-social-login.md)) |
| 3 | [Provision + test the two accounts](2026-06-27-phase-3-provision-and-test.md) | 1a, 1b, 2 | **Planned** ([spec](../specs/2026-07-01-phase-3-provision-and-test-design.md) · [plan](2026-07-01-phase-3-provision-and-test.md)) |

## Status legend

- **Roadmap — needs brainstorming:** scope captured; run the brainstorming skill
  to produce a spec, then writing-plans to produce a no-placeholder plan.
- **Designed:** spec complete and approved.
- **Plan in progress / complete:** bite-sized implementation plan being written.
