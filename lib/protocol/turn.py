"""The turn payload: everything the runner needs to run one turn.

The Fly server renders the system prompt, resolves the session seed, and mints
the capability tokens, then ships this to the sandbox runner's ``POST /turns``.
The runner holds no secrets of its own — every URL and token here is
conversation-scoped and revocable, and the model/DB credentials live behind the
``proxy_url`` and ``mcp_url`` endpoints, never in this payload.
