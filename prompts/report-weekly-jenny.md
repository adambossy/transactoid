# Weekly Spending Summary for Jenny

Generate a weekly spending summary for the week ending {{CURRENT_DATE}}.
Send the final report to jloleary0@gmail.com with subject "Weekly Spending Summary 📊".

## Budget

Check if `.transactoid/memory/budget.md` exists using `execute_shell_command`. If it does, read it for monthly budget targets.
Derive a 7-day target by multiplying the monthly "Proposed Budget" × (7 / 30.44).
If the file does not exist, omit all budget comparison columns from the report.

## Report Structure

### Header: Weekly Summary

Start the email with a brief header block containing:

1. **Total weekly spend** — the sum of all transactions in the last 7 days.
2. **Monthly budget tracking** — how total MTD spend compares to the overall monthly budget (amount spent / monthly budget, with % and dollar remaining).
3. **3 concise bullet points** — observations, wins, or areas that need attention this week. Keep each bullet to one sentence. Be specific (name merchants or categories).

### Section 1. Category Budget Table

An HTML `<table>` showing top-level categories with weekly and monthly context.

Columns:

1. **Category** — top-level category name
2. **This Week** — total spend in the last 7 days for this category
3. **MTD Spend** — total spend month-to-date for this category
4. **Monthly Budget** — the monthly target from budget.md
5. **Delta** — dollar difference (MTD Spend − Monthly Budget), prefixed with + or −

Color the **Delta** cell using these budget status shades:

- 25%+ under budget: `#1a7a1a` (dark green), white text
- 10–25% under budget: `#52b752` (medium green), white text
- 0–10% under budget: `#c8e6c9` (light green), black text
- 0–10% over budget: `#ffcdd2` (light red), black text
- 10–25% over budget: `#e05c5c` (medium red), white text
- 25%+ over budget: `#b71c1c` (dark red), white text

Include every category from budget.md that had spend this month. Skip zero-spend rows.
Add a **Total** row at the bottom.

### Section 2. Transaction Detail — Last 7 Days

An HTML `<table>` listing every transaction from the last 7 days in reverse chronological order.

Columns:

1. **Date** — transaction date
2. **Merchant** — merchant name
3. **Amount** — transaction amount
4. **Subcategory** — the subcategory assigned to the transaction
5. **Cumulative MTD** — the running month-to-date spend for that subcategory at the point this transaction was made (include this transaction's cost in the cumulative total)
6. **Budget Delta** — the difference between the subcategory's monthly budget and the Cumulative MTD column (budget − cumulative). Positive means under budget, negative means over.

Color the **Budget Delta** cell using the same budget status shades defined above.

### Section 3. Recommendations

Analyze spending from the last 15 days and write 4–6 short, friendly, concrete tips for
staying on track for the rest of the month. Use "we" where natural. Name specific
merchants or categories. Be encouraging, not scolding.

## Tone and Format

- Friendly and personal — this report goes to Jenny, not a finance analyst.
- All tables **must be raw HTML `<table>` elements** with inline CSS so colored cells render in email.
- Wrap the entire report in clean HTML with inline CSS suitable for email clients (no external stylesheets, no JavaScript).
- Keep the layout simple: the header summary, then the three sections in order.
