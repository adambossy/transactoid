web

## Users

**Primary: couples and households** — two people whose finances are
intertwined and who want them reasoned about together. The household is the
tenancy unit, not a feature bolted onto a single-player app: joint
conversations, per-member message attribution, per-row `private`/`shared`
visibility, invites, and a joint session that sees shared data only are all
core to the primary case.

Solo users are fully supported and are the on-ramp — signup auto-provisions an
isolated one-person household — but when a design decision forces a choice, the
two-person household wins.

One individual belongs to exactly one household. There is no household merge
and no multi-household membership; someone who wants into a different household
starts over and re-links their bank.

The user is financially engaged: they already care about their money closely
enough to connect real bank accounts and ask questions a spreadsheet can't
answer.

## Product Purpose

Penny is a personal-finance **agent**. It syncs bank and card transactions from
connected Plaid items, resolves each descriptor to a real merchant or
counterparty, categorizes every transaction (and every line of an itemized
order) against a two-level taxonomy, and then answers natural-language
questions about that data through a streaming chat interface. It also delivers
recurring spending reports by email — daily (rolled up to monthly on the 1st)
and weekly — produced by the same agent that powers chat.

Success is the user getting a real, reasoned answer to a hard question about
their own money — one they could not have gotten from a budgeting app, and
would not have assembled by hand.

## Positioning

Penny reasons over the user's **entire** financial history, not the last
month's totals. The mechanism a neighboring product cannot truthfully copy: an
LLM agent with read-only SQL access to the user's complete, merchant-normalized,
per-item-itemized transaction history, isolated per household.

All six of these are capabilities Penny genuinely has today, not aspirations:

- **Root-cause analysis** — detect the months where spending broke pattern and
  decompose each spike to the merchants and one-off events behind it,
  separating a real behavior shift from a single anomalous charge.
- **Scenario modeling** — project a decision forward from real balances (rent
  vs. buy, a job change, a large purchase): down payment, opportunity cost,
  principal paydown, appreciation, and the break-even point.
- **Disciplined budgeting** — build from a full 12 months of averages,
  smoothing trips and holidays, then contract each discretionary line by a
  chosen margin while holding essentials fixed.
- **Forward cash flow** — project balances from recurring income, bills and
  subscriptions, and the seasonal shape of the user's own history, flagging the
  months they will run tight.
- **Behavioral trends** — year over year, category by category, isolating where
  a baseline is quietly ratcheting up from where the user simply splurged once.
- **Goal optimization** — take a target (amount and deadline) and
  reverse-engineer it against actual spending, ranking specific cuts from least
  to most painful.

## Operating Context

**Chat is the only front door.** There is no dashboard, wizard, stepper, or
setup screen. A new user lands directly in a conversation, and setup happens
through the agent: it nudges toward connecting a bank, reviewing account
visibility, tuning the taxonomy, and adding merchant rules at deterministic
milestones — at most once per turn, never in a joint thread, and never again
once a step is dismissed (though it stays revisitable by simply asking). The
onboarding state driving these nudges is invisible to the user and never
appears in the transcript.

**Capabilities arrive as inline cards inside chat**, not as separate screens:
Plaid Link (initial connect and re-authentication of a broken connection) and
"Connect a provider" for credentials both render in the conversation. Plaid runs
in the browser; the public token is exchanged server-side.

**Surfaces that exist:** a public logged-out marketing home page at `/`
(hero with sample prompts, six-part feature tour with demo conversations,
closing call-to-action); sign-in and sign-up; new chat; a deep-linkable
conversation at `/c/:id`; a chat-history drawer listing the principal's
conversations newest-first; a providers & billing settings screen; invite
management; and a design-system gallery. The URL is the source of truth for
what is on screen, and browser back/forward walk between views.

**Beyond the browser:** recurring email reports; a persistent per-user
workspace (`memory/`, `reports/`) carrying state such as budget notes across
both chat and scheduled runs, partitioned into a shared workspace per household
and a private one per user; and optional Amazon order scraping so a lump charge
becomes per-item spending.

**Evaluation context:** the person judging Penny is looking at their own real
money. Plausible-looking output that is wrong is worse than no answer.

## Capabilities and Constraints

**Confirmed capabilities** are enumerated as P1–P13 in `REQUIREMENTS.txt`, the
living spec — that file, not this one, is the authority on functional scope, and
a behavioral claim not present there should be treated as unverified.

**Durable constraints:**

- **Light-only appearance.** The web app renders exclusively in the light
  "cream" design system on every screen. It never follows the OS
  `prefers-color-scheme: dark` preference and exposes no light/dark toggle
  (`REQUIREMENTS.txt` P11). Design work operates entirely within the light
  system; there is no dark variant to design for.
- **English (US) and `$` only.** Reports and chat responses are written in
  English with dollar currency regardless of the language of transaction
  descriptors or memory notes. There is no localization or i18n today.
- **The agent's SQL access is read-only.** `run_sql` accepts a single read-only
  `SELECT`; the agent cannot mutate finance data through it.
- **One individual = one household.** No merge, no multi-household membership.
  An email that already belongs to an active account cannot be invited.
- **Invites reach new people only.** A household member can invite accountless
  people by email; the invitee signs up straight into the inviter's household.
- **Data isolation is enforced, not advisory.** Every financial row belongs to
  exactly one household and one owning user with `private`/`shared` visibility,
  enforced by Postgres row-level security plus app-level filtering.
- **Signup is fully open.** Any visitor can sign up via social login and is
  auto-provisioned an isolated household with its own seeded taxonomy. Cost is
  bounded by the per-user subsidy cap, not by a gate.
- **BYO keys after a small subsidy.** Each user gets a small subsidized token
  runway on their first Plaid link (default $2); once spent, the user must
  connect their own provider credential — an API key or a sanctioned OAuth
  subscription — to keep chatting. There is no ambient fallback to a platform
  key on a billing-enabled deployment: with no credential and no runway, the
  turn is blocked rather than silently billed to the platform.

**Explicitly undecided:** pricing and packaging beyond the default $2 subsidy
runway. No pricing page or plan structure exists, and none should be invented.

**Terminology** is fixed by the glossary in `backend/CONTEXT.md` and must be
reused rather than paraphrased in any user-facing copy: *household*, *user*,
*pending user*, *invite*, *principal*, *joint session*, *visibility*,
*transaction* (the derived, enriched record) vs. *Plaid transaction* (the
immutable source row), *Plaid item* (one bank login), *Plaid account*,
*sync*, *descriptor*, *wrapper descriptor*, *merchant*, *counterparty*,
*normalization*, *categorization*, *itemization*. Avoid "account" for a person
and "member" as an entity name.

## Brand Commitments

- **Name:** Penny. The agent is referred to in the third person and gendered
  she/her in existing product copy.
- **Visual identity is already established and binding.** The light-only cream
  design system — its tokens, theme, primitives, logo assets, and self-hosted
  fonts — lives in `frontend/packages/ui` and is the incumbent visual
  authority for every screen. It is a canonical product constraint (P11), not a
  starting suggestion. Logo assets exist in light-only form; there are no dark
  variants.
- **Not confirmed binding:** the tagline "your finance savant" and the rest of
  `frontend/src/home/copy.ts`, which that file itself labels placeholder
  wording carried from a design reference. Copy is expected to iterate; the home
  page's structure and call-to-action routing are the requirement, not its
  words.

## Evidence on Hand

**Real, and usable:**

- The author's own live financial data — connected Plaid items, real synced and
  categorized transactions.
- A working, deployed product (backend, frontend, cron-manager, and a
  categorizer-eval app), with real scheduled email reports going out.
- Hand-authored worked examples in `frontend/src/home/artifacts.tsx` — the
  charts and ledger tables the marketing page uses to show the shape of Penny's
  answers. Their figures are internally consistent by construction, which is
  precisely why they must never be presented as a real household's results:
  they are authored illustrations, not captured output, and every panel that
  renders them carries an "Illustrative figures" marker.

**Absent — future work must not fabricate any of it.** Penny is pre-launch,
with the author as its only real user. There are **no** testimonials, quotes,
named customers, customer logos, user or household counts, growth or usage
metrics, retention numbers, dollars-analyzed figures, press mentions, awards,
case studies, third-party reviews, ratings, funding announcements, team
bios, uptime or accuracy benchmarks, security certifications, or completed
audits. No "trusted by", no "join N users", no star ratings, no logo wall.
Where a surface would conventionally carry social proof, it must earn belief
another way — by demonstrating the reasoning itself.

## Product Principles

1. **Chat is the product; there is no second interface.** New capability
   arrives through conversation or an inline card within it — never as another
   dashboard, wizard, or settings maze. A surface that pulls the user out of the
   conversation has to justify itself.
2. **Answer the hard question, not the easy one.** Depth over totals: root
   cause, projection, trade-off, computed across the full history. Never build a
   surface whose promise is a summary Penny already surpasses.
3. **Two people, one set of finances.** Every surface must read correctly for a
   household of two with a mix of private and shared rows — not a solo design
   retrofitted with a sharing toggle.
4. **Claim only what is true.** With one real user and no proof on hand, every
   capability claim traces to `REQUIREMENTS.txt` and every number is real or
   absent. Invented evidence is the one failure that costs a finance product
   everything.
5. **Make isolation and cost legible.** Who can see a row, which household it
   belongs to, whose credential is paying for a turn, and what remains of a
   runway are user-facing promises about money and privacy, not backend
   implementation details. Surfaces should let the user verify them, not just
   trust them.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

No product-specific accessibility standard or target has been established, and
none is claimed. Two established constraints shape the work: the interface is
light-only by requirement, so all contrast and legibility work happens within
the light cream system with no dark variant to fall back on; and the product is
English (US) with `$` currency only, with no localization today.
