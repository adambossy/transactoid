# Monthly Spending Report

Generate a comprehensive spending report for {{CURRENT_MONTH}} {{CURRENT_YEAR}}.

## Your Budget Targets

These are my monthly budget targets by category:

- **Housing**: $2,500/month (rent, utilities, maintenance)
- **Food**: $800/month total
  - Groceries: $500/month
  - Restaurants/Dining: $300/month
- **Transportation**: $400/month (gas, parking, transit, rideshare)
- **Health & Fitness**: $200/month (gym, supplements, medical)
- **Entertainment**: $150/month (streaming, movies, games)
- **Shopping**: $200/month (clothing, electronics, household)
- **Personal Care**: $100/month (haircuts, toiletries)
- **Subscriptions**: $100/month (software, memberships)

**Total Monthly Budget Target**: $4,450/month

## What I Consider "Unusual"

- Any single transaction over $500 that isn't recurring (rent, car payment, etc.)
- Any merchant I've never transacted with before that has charges over $100
- Any category where spending is 50% or more above the 3-month average
- Duplicate charges from the same merchant on the same day

## My Financial Goals & Priorities

- **Primary goal**: Keep total monthly spending under $5,000
- **Savings target**: $1,000/month to savings
- **OK to splurge on**: Quality food and fitness (these improve my health and productivity)
- **Need to cut back on**: Impulse shopping, dining out, and subscription creep
- **Seasonal considerations**: Holiday spending in Nov/Dec, travel in summer months

## Report Sections to Generate

Please analyze my transaction data and generate a report with these sections:

### 1. Executive Summary
- Total spending this month vs. last month (amount and % change)
- Top 3 areas of concern (overspending or unusual patterns)
- Top 3 positive trends (good spending habits or savings)
- Am I on track to meet my $5,000/month target?

### 2. Category Spending Breakdown
For each major category:
- Amount spent this month
- Budget target vs. actual (over/under)
- Comparison to 3-month average
- Flag any category where I'm spending 50%+ above average

### 3. Spending Trends (3, 6, and 12 months)
For each category with significant data:
- **Overspending trend**: Categories where spending has been consistently increasing
- **Underspending trend**: Categories where I'm spending less than usual (potential savings)
- **Stable trend**: Categories where spending is consistent
- Include specific numbers and percentages

### 4. Unusual or Major Expenses
List any transactions that meet my "unusual" criteria above:
- Transaction date, merchant, amount, category
- Why it's flagged (first-time merchant, unusually high, duplicate, etc.)
- Whether it seems like a one-time expense or something to watch

### 5. Predicted Upcoming Expenses
Based on historical patterns:
- **Recurring subscriptions/bills**: What's due in the next 30 days?
- **Seasonal patterns**: Based on the same time last year, what should I expect?
- **Annual expenses approaching**: Insurance, memberships, etc.

### 6. Actionable Recommendations
Be specific and honest:
- **Cut back on**: Specific merchants or categories where I'm overspending
- **Maintain**: Areas where my spending is healthy and aligned with goals
- **OK to splurge**: Where I can afford to spend more without guilt
- **Watch out for**: Potential issues or creeping expenses to monitor

## Output Format

Format the report in clean markdown suitable for email delivery. Use tables for numerical comparisons where appropriate. Include actual dollar amounts, percentages, and specific merchant names. Be direct and honest about overspending - I want actionable insights, not sugar-coated summaries.
