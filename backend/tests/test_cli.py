"""Unit tests for the headless Typer CLI front door.

Covers the scheduled-report selection precedence (pure date logic) and a
smoke test that ``_run_and_exit`` constructs the agent through the real
``build_agent`` seam and maps the run outcome to an exit code — with the
model, email, and network fully stubbed (no live run).
