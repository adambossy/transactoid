"""Injection seam for the onboarding-resolve op (website-owned persistence).

Resolving an onboarding step writes ``web.onboarding_items`` — website/app state
the agent domain must not import (AGENTS.local.md). The website constructs its
persistence-backed resolver and passes it to ``build_agent``, which threads it
into the ``resolve_onboarding_item`` tool; the agent domain sees only this
