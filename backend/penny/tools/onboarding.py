"""Agent tool: record a user's accept/decline of an onboarding nudge.

Thin ``@tool`` over an injected ``OnboardingResolver`` (the website/app-domain
persistence op). The tool does not touch the web store directly — the website
constructs the resolver and threads it in via ``build_agent`` → ``build_toolset``
→ :func:`make_resolve_onboarding_item`, so the agent domain never imports
``penny.api.persistence`` (decision D5). The tool never *performs* the underlying
action (linking a bank, editing taxonomy): those are other tools. This only marks
the nudge resolved so onboarding stops surfacing it.
