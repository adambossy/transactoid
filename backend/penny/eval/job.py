"""The eval job: one unattended run (every 12h).

Cohort (ingested since the last watermark) -> writable SQLite snapshot of prod
finance data (through the read-only role, RLS-scoped) -> replay the agent on the
snapshot -> record durable eval rows to prod -> upload the run's artifacts
(report HTML, SQLite fixture, items JSON) to R2 -> email a status line every run
(a link to the hosted report when legacy!=agent disagree). Nothing waits on a
human; right/wrong is read later from your corrections.

No Neon branch, no ``neonctl``, no control-plane credential: the replay runs on
a local SQLite copy, so the untrusted agent can never reach prod. Bulk finance
reads go through the SELECT-only role (``PENNY_AGENT_READONLY_DATABASE_URL``);
only the narrow eval-store writes use the read-write ``DATABASE_URL``.

The eval deliberately reuses the agent's read-only role rather than minting a
dedicated one: both are SELECT-only and RLS-scoped, so a second credential earns
nothing. Split to a ``PENNY_EVAL_READONLY_DATABASE_URL`` only if the eval's read
grants ever need to diverge from the agent's.
