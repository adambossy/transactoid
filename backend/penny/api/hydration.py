"""Render stored conversation messages as AI SDK ``UIMessage`` JSON.

Used by ``GET /api/sessions/{id}`` so the frontend can rehydrate a conversation
after a refresh or backend restart. Because the bridge captured every part at
full fidelity (``MessageAccumulator``), the stored ``parts`` array is already in
UI shape — hydration is near-passthrough. There is no longer any need to
reconstruct UI parts from the lossy harness transcript, so the old
``messages_to_ui`` path (and its ``_parse_maybe_json`` / ``_collect_tool_results``
heuristics and the ``ThinkingBlock`` special-case) are gone.
