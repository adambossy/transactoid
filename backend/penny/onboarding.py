"""Deterministic progressive-onboarding engine (website/app domain).

Onboarding is website/app state (decision D1/D5): the items live in the ``web``
schema and this module owns the state machine + per-turn trigger evaluation. The
website chat handler calls :func:`ensure_items` + :func:`evaluate` each turn and
enqueues the returned consolidated reminder; the agent's
``resolve_onboarding_item`` tool calls :func:`resolve` on explicit accept/decline.

The engine is deterministic (spec §4): given the same stored state and signals it
returns the same activation set, so a reminder's content is a pure function of
state — never model- or client-derived text. Activation is *computed* here, never
stored; only ``status`` (``pending``/``accepted``/``dismissed``) persists.
