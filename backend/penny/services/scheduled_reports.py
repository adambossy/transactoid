"""Schedule selection logic for automated (cron) report runs.

A daily cron run drives the agent with the ``spending-report`` skill, scoped
to the period chosen by New-York wall-clock precedence:

    annual (Jan 1) > monthly (day 1) > weekly (Sunday) > daily

Selection returns a *period* (``daily`` / ``weekly`` / ``monthly`` /
``annual``), and :func:`report_prompt` turns it into a natural-language
request that triggers the period-parameterized ``spending-report`` skill.
There are intentionally no ``report-*`` promptorium keys: the skill is the
single source of report logic, so the four periods cannot drift apart.
