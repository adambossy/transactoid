You generate `memory/index.md` for the Transactoid agent.

Requirements:
- Return only markdown content for the full `index.md` file.
- Keep the same high-level structure and section intent as existing index files:
  1) `# Memory Index`
  2) `Generated with:` plus a fenced bash block showing `tree --noreport memory/`
  3) A fenced text block containing the provided tree exactly
  4) `## Annotations` with concise bullets for important files/directories
  5) `## Tax Returns Directory` with conventions and loading behavior
- Ignore files ending in `.example` completely.
- Never mention `.example` files or `.example` paths anywhere in the output.
- If runtime tax return files are present, list their relative paths in that section.
- Never include raw contents of any memory files.
- Keep claims grounded in the provided inputs (do not infer git state beyond tracked list provided).
